GAME RULE:

  In the game, a layer of bricks lines the top third of the screen. A ball travels across the screen, bouncing off the top and side walls of the screen. When a brick is hit, the ball bounces away and the brick is destroyed. The player loses a turn when the ball touches the bottom of the screen. To prevent this from happening, the player has a movable paddle to bounce the ball upward, keeping it in play.
  
  The speed of the ball will be changed faster and faster when it hit the bricks over 4 times and 12 times. Also it will be changed when the ball hit the red bricks and orange bricks.
  
  If the yellow brick is hit,the user get 1 score. if the grenn brick is hit,the user get 3 score. if the orange brick is hit,the user get 5 score. if the red brick is hit,,the user get 7 score.
